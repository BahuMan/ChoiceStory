# Choose Your Own Adventure for Badger2040

Small text-adventure engine, where a little bit of text is presented
on the badger's e-ink screen, and then 3 choices are presented
using the bottom 3 buttons. Each of the buttons jumps to a different
part of the story.

The idea is to read the story from a file in flash memory.
When the badger is plugged into a PC, this file can be edited with
any text editor to create extra chapters in the adventure.
